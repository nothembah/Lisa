                Oh man where do I begin with you 😂there’s a lot to say anyway it’s been an amazing four years doing this friendship/sisterhood with you and I hope we will continue building our relationship going forward. I know I have told you this a million times, but I am going say it again because this is very special to me as you are🥺. The way you carry yourself, the warmth energy around you as well as your personality is the reason why I knew I wanted to be your friend the first time I saw you🤞 even though everyone found you intimidating. Only God knows how grateful I am to have you by side you are such a caring soul and always looking out for everyone basically you are the mother of our squad 😂😂😂. We may not speak or see each other as often as we should but know that I appreciate you, and you have my heart🥺❤. 💃<br><br>
                Without dwelling on it too much and making you emotional thank you for always being my hype woman and my big sister. I want you to know you’ve given me the tightest hug when I needed it the most, the broadest smile when I just couldn’t see the sun, the funniest joke when I couldn’t find a giggle🥺 Today, I do not only remember that it’s your birthday, but I do remember as well, the day I found a friend in you🥰I want you to accomplish your dreams and turn every odd into blessings. As they say words can’t tell it all and music can’t sing it all because you are deeper than what meets the eye. I want to wish you a blissful birthday filled with Joy and happiness 🥰. Above all these, the one filled with love and a lot of blessings from God. Today is Lisa’s national day as we celebrate you yeeeeyi 💃💃💃💃happy birthday babes I love you so much. ♥️♥️♥️</p>
