            <p class="words">
                First of all, happy birthday! ❤️ Second of all, I have no words to describe how grateful I am that you’re a part of my life. You’re one of the few people I can be fully open with about my life and know that I will not be met with any judgement - I appreciate that so much. You probably have the biggest and warmest heart I know and I hope the world never changes that about you. Also, I know you had already started but I hope you learn to say “no” more, for your sake. I hope this next year brings you nothing but love, blessings and abundance in every aspect. I wish you health & healing. And lastly, I hope I can be/am an amazing friend to you as you are to me. ENJOY 22! 🎈</p>
