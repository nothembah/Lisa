            <h1>My Dearest Lisa</h1>

            <p class="words">
                I am a person of words and have spent many years trying to will them into beautiful poetry but when confronted with explaining to the people I love just how much of me I willingly give over to them without hesitation, I freeze. There is no way that 26 letters of the alphabet can enclose just how much I love you and how much you mean to me.<br><br>

                You are the warmest of suns in my universe. You bring light and turn my darkest nights into day. You make my loving of women and our community so easy because I see it's potential within you, I see how women can love, build and uplift one another to the greatest of heights with complete selflessness within you.<br><br>
                
                I know I am not the most intentional of friends when it comes to my actions and I can disappear for the longest of times, but you welcome me home with the most amount of love you have every time because you see my heart. I love you so much I talk to God about you.<br><br>
                
                Thank you for just being.</p>

                Nothemba.</h1>
