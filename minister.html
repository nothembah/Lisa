            <h1>Hey Lisa ;-) </h1>

            <p class="words"> It's the Minister 
                i wanna wish you a happy birthday.
                thank you for always being so kind and caring.
                and making sure i'm always good when i'm around you.
                you have such a warm presence and i feel it everything you come around. 
                i know God is doing amazing things in your life and i can't wait
                to see the women of God you'll become.
                your sense of humor does it for me,
                i love laughing with you cause it's always so genuine.
                i love the fact that we can have light chats that can just go deep any moment
                and it's "how did we get here?" but all that just shows the openness and care of our friendship.
                may God continue to bless you forever and always.
                i love you LISA!!!
                HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!</p>
