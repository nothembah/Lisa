            <h1>DEAR LA LISA,</h1>

            <p class="words">There are many shiny things, pretty places and memorable moments we could share that would all be considered gifts. But I believe the greatest gift you've received is learning to love yourself deeper. To face everything in you, in front of, and behind you with courage. I've seen you learn not just how to stand strong, as you've always known, but also how to stand deep and rooted. To connect, hope and love deeper than before.

                I searched Google like the word-obsessed homie I be, and found that Lisa means a lot of things, but I liked the meaning of "God's promise" the most. Why? Because my word-obsessed self went and found out that "promise" broken down means "to put before/forth/ahead". I believe that all you have achieved and all you will achieve has been placed in advance and prepared for your taking. So grab it with all that you are as you become all that you will be.
                <br>
                <br>
                Not only that, but I believe you have been placed ahead of the masses and generations. Placed ahead to lead them into promised lands spoken of in your spirit. Spoken of by the whispers of vision God imbues within you.
